University Grading System

This document explains the grading system used to evaluate student academic performance. The system is designed to provide a clear and consistent measure of achievement across all courses and programs.

The university employs a letter grade system corresponding to a range of percentage marks and grade points. The standard grading scale is as follows: A (Excellent) represents 90-100%, B (Good) represents 80-89%, C (Satisfactory) represents 70-79%, D (Passing) represents 60-69%, and F (Fail) represents 0-59%. Some departments may use plus/minus modifiers (e.g., B+, B-) for more granular evaluation. The grade of 'I' (Incomplete) may be assigned temporarily when a student, for documented reasons beyond their control, has not completed a small portion of the course work. An 'I' must be resolved within a stipulated time frame, or it will convert to an 'F'.

The pass/fail criteria are straightforward. A grade of D or higher is required to pass a course and earn the associated credits. A grade of F indicates failure, and no credits are awarded. The student must then repeat the course if it is mandatory for their degree program. For some core or prerequisite courses, a minimum grade of C may be required to progress to the next level; students should consult their specific program requirements.

The Grade Point Average (GPA) is a numerical representation of a student's overall academic performance. It is calculated by multiplying the grade point value of each letter grade (A=4.0, B=3.0, C=2.0, D=1.0, F=0.0) by the credit hours for that course, summing these products for all courses taken in a period, and then dividing by the total number of credit hours attempted. The Semester GPA is based on one term's work, while the Cumulative GPA (CGPA) encompasses all terms completed. A minimum CGPA, often 2.0, is required for graduation and for maintaining good academic standing.

Students have the right to request a rechecking of their final examination answer script if they believe an error has occurred in the grading. Such a request must be made in writing to the examination controller's office within two weeks of the official grade release, accompanied by a prescribed fee. The recheck involves verifying that all answers have been marked and that the total has been summed correctly; it is not a re-evaluation of the academic judgment of the examiner. For more substantive appeals regarding a course grade, students must follow the formal academic appeal process, which begins with a discussion with the course instructor.

Academic standing is determined by both the CGPA and the rate of credit completion. Students falling below a 2.0 CGPA will be placed on academic probation. While on probation, students may face restrictions on their course load and extracurricular activities. Failure to raise the CGPA to the required minimum within the specified period may result in academic dismissal.
