Examination Rules and Conduct

The following rules govern the conduct of all university examinations. Their purpose is to ensure a fair, secure, and orderly testing environment for all students. Violations of these rules are treated with utmost seriousness and will result in disciplinary action.

Students must arrive at the examination hall at least 15 minutes before the scheduled start time. Late arrivals may be permitted entry at the discretion of the Chief Invigilator, but no additional time will be granted to compensate for the late start. Students arriving more than 30 minutes after the exam has begun will typically not be allowed to enter. A valid university student identification card must be presented for admission to the exam hall. Without this ID, entry will be denied unless alternative verification is arranged in advance with the examination office.

Only authorized materials may be brought into the examination hall. All bags, books, notes, electronic devices (including mobile phones, smart watches, and any wireless communication devices), and other personal belongings must be deposited in the designated area outside the hall. Only writing instruments, a clear bottle of water, and specifically permitted calculators (as announced for the exam) are allowed on the desk. Any paper required will be provided by the invigilation staff. Wristwatches must be analog; digital or smart watches are strictly prohibited.

Cheating and academic misconduct during examinations are grave offenses. Cheating includes, but is not limited to, communicating with other students, copying from another student's work, using unauthorized aids, possessing written notes, or attempting to access electronic information. Any student found engaging in such misconduct will have their examination script confiscated immediately. They will be asked to leave the examination hall and will receive a grade of zero for that examination. A formal report will be filed with the Disciplinary Committee, which may impose additional penalties, including suspension or expulsion from the university, depending on the severity of the offense.

During the examination, invigilators and the Chief Invigilator have full authority to maintain order. They are empowered to inspect any item on a student's desk or person, to relocate students, and to issue warnings. Students must follow all instructions given by the invigilation staff promptly and without argument. Disruptive behavior, such as talking, creating disturbances, or refusing to follow instructions, will result in removal from the hall and disciplinary consequences. The university reserves the right to use electronic surveillance and other measures to uphold the integrity of its examinations.
