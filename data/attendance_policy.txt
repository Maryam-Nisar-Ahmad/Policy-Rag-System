University Attendance Policy

This policy outlines the mandatory attendance requirements for all enrolled students. Regular attendance is considered fundamental to academic success, as classroom interaction, discussions, and lectures are integral parts of the learning process. The university expects students to attend all scheduled sessions for the courses in which they are registered.

All undergraduate students must maintain a minimum attendance of 75% in each course throughout the semester. For laboratory sessions, workshops, and studio-based courses, the minimum requirement is 80%. Attendance is recorded from the first official day of the semester. It is the student's responsibility to ensure they are marked present and to follow up with the instructor in case of any discrepancy in the record.

The consequences of low attendance are serious and progressive. If a student's attendance in a course falls below the minimum requirement, they will be issued an academic warning. Should the attendance deficit persist, the student will be barred from appearing for the final examination in that course. A bar from examination automatically results in a failing grade for that course, requiring repetition in a subsequent semester. In exceptional cases, where attendance is marginally below the threshold due to compelling circumstances, a student may petition their department head for consideration, but such exceptions are rarely granted.

Medical leave is recognized, but proper documentation is required for it to be considered excused. For any illness requiring an absence of more than three consecutive days, a student must submit a medical certificate from a recognized healthcare provider. This certificate must be submitted to the university's health center for verification within one week of returning to classes. The health center will then issue an official excused absence notice to the relevant faculty and department. Excused medical absences are not automatically excluded from attendance calculations; however, they may form the basis for an appeal against exam barring if the minimum attendance could not be met due to prolonged, documented illness.

Attendance is directly linked to examination eligibility. No student will be permitted to sit for the end-of-semester examinations unless their attendance record, as certified by the course instructor and department, meets the stipulated minimum. The administration of final examination hall tickets is contingent upon a cleared attendance status. Students are strongly advised to monitor their attendance regularly via the student portal and to communicate proactively with their instructors if unforeseen circumstances affect their ability to attend classes. The university believes that consistent engagement is a key indicator of a student's commitment to their academic program.
