Student Disciplinary Procedures and Actions

The university maintains a code of conduct to foster a safe, respectful, and productive academic environment. This document outlines common types of misconduct, the disciplinary process, and the range of potential actions that may be taken.

Misconduct is categorized into academic and non-academic violations. Academic misconduct includes plagiarism, cheating on examinations, fabrication of data, and unauthorized collaboration. Non-academic misconduct encompasses a broad range of behaviors, including but not limited to: vandalism of university property, theft, harassment (sexual or otherwise), physical assault, possession of illegal substances, violation of residence hall rules, hazing, and any behavior that endangers the health or safety of others or disrupts university operations.

The university employs a progressive disciplinary system designed to correct behavior while protecting the community. For minor first offenses, an informal resolution may involve a meeting with a university official, a verbal warning, and/or educational sanctions (e.g., attending a workshop). More serious or repeated offenses trigger formal disciplinary proceedings. This begins with a written charge and an investigation. The student will be formally notified of the allegations and the evidence against them. They have the right to present their own account and provide evidence in their defense.

Depending on the severity of the misconduct, a case may be heard by a designated administrator or by a formal Disciplinary Committee. The student has several rights during these proceedings, including the right to receive advance notice of the hearing, the right to be accompanied by an advisor (who may be a faculty member, staff, or fellow student, but not legal counsel in standard proceedings), the right to hear the evidence presented, and the right to present their own case and witnesses. Decisions are made based on a preponderance of the evidence standard.

Penalties are imposed according to the nature and gravity of the violation. They include, in ascending order of severity: formal written reprimand, disciplinary probation, restitution for damages, community service, loss of privileges (e.g., exclusion from campus activities or facilities), suspension, and expulsion. Suspension is the separation of the student from the university for a defined period, after which they may apply for reinstatement. Expulsion is permanent separation from the university. A record of disciplinary action is maintained in the student's file; records of suspension or expulsion are typically permanent. The outcome of all formal proceedings may be appealed to a designated appellate body within the university within a specified timeframe.
