Academic Integrity and Plagiarism Policy

The university upholds the highest standards of academic honesty. Plagiarism constitutes a fundamental violation of these standards and undermines the integrity of the academic community. This policy defines plagiarism and outlines the procedures and penalties associated with it.

Plagiarism is the act of presenting the ideas, words, designs, or work of another person as one's own, without appropriate acknowledgment. It applies to all submitted work, including essays, reports, code, projects, theses, and examination answers. Plagiarism can be intentional or unintentional, but both are considered breaches of this policy.

Examples of plagiarism are varied. Directly copying sentences, paragraphs, or data from a book, article, website, or another student's work without quotation marks and a citation is plagiarism. Paraphrasing someone else's ideas or arguments without crediting the original source is also plagiarism. Submitting work that has been purchased, acquired from a paper mill, or produced by someone else (including artificial intelligence tools without proper attribution and disclosure) is a severe form of plagiarism. Even reusing substantial portions of one's own previously submitted work for a new assignment without the explicit permission of the current instructor can be considered self-plagiarism.

The proper use of sources is essential. Students must learn and employ a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago) as required by their department. All direct quotations must be enclosed in quotation marks and followed by a precise citation. When paraphrasing or summarizing another's idea, a citation must still be provided. A bibliography or reference list must accompany all assignments, detailing all sources consulted.

Penalties for plagiarism are enforced to reflect the severity of the offense. For a minor or first offense involving a small portion of work, the penalty may range from a zero on the assignment to a failing grade for the course. The student will also be required to complete an academic integrity tutorial. For serious, repeated, or extensive plagiarism—such as submitting a paper written by another—the penalties are more severe. These can include an automatic failing grade in the course, academic probation, suspension, or even expulsion from the university. All instances of confirmed plagiarism are recorded in the student's disciplinary file. Upholding academic honesty is a shared responsibility, and the university provides resources through the library and writing center to help students learn proper research and citation practices.
