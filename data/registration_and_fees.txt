Course Registration and Fee Payment Policy

This section details the processes and regulations governing course registration and the payment of tuition and other fees. Adherence to these deadlines and procedures is essential for a smooth academic progression.

The course registration process occurs prior to the start of each semester. Students must register online during the designated registration window. Registration involves selecting courses for the upcoming term in consultation with an academic advisor, who must approve the selection to ensure it aligns with the student's degree plan. Failure to register during this period results in the student not being officially enrolled for the semester. After initial registration, there is an add/drop period, typically lasting for the first two weeks of the semester. During this time, students may adjust their schedules by adding or dropping courses without financial or academic penalty. A dropped course will not appear on the academic transcript.

Late registration carries significant consequences. Students who register after the official window closes but before the end of the add/drop period will incur a substantial late registration fee. Registration after the add/drop period ends is generally not permitted, except under extraordinary circumstances with the approval of the Dean of Academic Affairs. In such cases, a higher fee is levied, and the student is responsible for catching up on all missed coursework.

Tuition and mandatory fees are due and payable in full before the first day of classes for the semester. A detailed invoice is available on the student portal. The university offers a payment plan option, which must be arranged with the finance office before the due date. This plan allows for installment payments, but a non-refundable administrative fee applies, and the first installment is still due before the semester begins. Payments can be made electronically, by bank transfer, or at the university cashier's office.

Consequences for unpaid fees are strictly enforced. Students with outstanding balances after the due date will have a financial hold placed on their account. A financial hold blocks access to critical services, including future registration, receipt of official transcripts, and diploma release. If the balance remains unpaid beyond a specified grace period (usually 30 days into the semester), the student may be administratively withdrawn from all courses. Administrative withdrawal means the student loses their seat in classes and may receive non-punitive grades of "W" or no record on their transcript, but they remain financially liable for a percentage of the tuition as per the university's withdrawal refund schedule. It is the student's responsibility to monitor their account status and settle all dues in a timely manner.
